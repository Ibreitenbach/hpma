duet_modes:
  TWIN_HELIX:
    name: "Twin-Helix"
    ratio: "~50/50"
    description: "Both voices are equally active. Context determines which leads at any moment."
    adds:
      strengths:
        - "Context-switching: you can run two engines without collapsing into one."
        - "Versatility: different situations call different voices forward naturally."
        - "Integration potential: when both align, you have unusual depth."
      watchouts:
        - "Oscillation risk: swapping engines mid-decision can look like indecision."
        - "Identity confusion: 'which one am I really?' is a common internal question."
        - "Energy drain: maintaining two active modes requires more cognitive bandwidth."
      prescriptions:
        - "Use explicit switching rules (e.g., 'morning is anchor time, evening is lens time')."
        - "Name which voice is driving before big decisions."
        - "Create rituals that honor both voices regularly."

  LEANING_HELIX:
    name: "Leaning Helix"
    ratio: "~60/40"
    description: "One voice leads slightly, but the other remains a strong co-driver."
    adds:
      strengths:
        - "Slight clarity: one voice has a gentle home-court advantage."
        - "Dynamic balance: still flexible enough to switch without strain."
        - "Reduced identity friction compared to pure Twin-Helix."
      watchouts:
        - "Drift risk: the 60% voice may slowly absorb the 40% over time."
        - "Lens suppression: the secondary voice may feel perpetually 'almost' expressed."
      prescriptions:
        - "Consciously activate the secondary voice weekly."
        - "Notice when you're defaulting and ask if the other voice would serve better."

  KEYSTONE_LENS:
    name: "Keystone & Lens"
    ratio: "~75/25"
    description: "One clear keystone engine, with a consistent lens coloring expression."
    adds:
      strengths:
        - "Clarity: you know what drives you; decisions are faster."
        - "Consistency: others can predict your patterns."
        - "Lens depth: the 25% adds nuance without confusion."
      watchouts:
        - "Lens neglect: the secondary voice may atrophy if never given airtime."
        - "Rigidity: over-reliance on the keystone can blind you to when the lens should lead."
      prescriptions:
        - "Schedule lens-expression time weekly or biweekly."
        - "Ask: 'What would my lens voice say here?' before finalizing decisions."
        - "Create one lens-honoring ritual that's non-negotiable."

    name: "Signature & Accent"
    ratio: "~90/10"

      strengths:
        - "Strong identity: you know exactly who you are."
        - "Efficiency: decisions align with one clear value system."
        - "Accent subtlety: the 10% adds texture without complication."
      watchouts:
        - "Accent dismissal: the minor voice may be treated as 'not really me.'"
        - "Blind spots: the accent often holds wisdom the signature ignores."
      prescriptions:
        - "Monthly check-in: 'What is my accent voice trying to tell me?'"
        - "Notice when the accent voice surfaces—it's usually important."

  PURELINE:
    name: "Pureline"
    ratio: "~95/5+"
    description: "Near-pure single-voice orientation with trace coloring."
    adds:
      strengths:
        - "Extreme clarity: your identity is unmistakable."
        - "Focus: no internal negotiation required."
        - "Depth: you've likely developed this voice thoroughly."
      watchouts:
        - "Shadow blindness: the 5% often holds suppressed material."
        - "Inflexibility: situations requiring the trace voice may feel alien."
        - "Over-identification: you may resist acknowledging the trace exists."
      prescriptions:
        - "Acknowledge the trace voice exists, even if it rarely leads."
        - "When stuck, ask: 'What would my 5% suggest?'"

trio_modes:
  TRI_HELIX:
    name: "Tri-Helix"
    ratio: "~33/33/33"

        - "Maximum versatility: you have three distinct modes available."
        - "Resilience: if one voice is blocked, two others remain."
        - "Depth: triple-perspective on every situation."
      watchouts:
        - "Decision paralysis: three voices can debate indefinitely."
        - "Identity diffusion: 'Who am I really?' intensifies."
        - "Energy cost: maintaining three active modes is demanding."
      prescriptions:
        - "Assign situations to voices: 'Work = Voice A, Home = Voice B, Creative = Voice C.'"
        - "Use time-boxing: let each voice have dedicated expression windows."

  KEYSTONE_PRISM:
    name: "Keystone Prism"

      strengths:
        - "Clear command structure: keystone decides, lens advises, shadow watches."
        - "Shadow wisdom: the 15% often holds unconventional insights."
        - "Efficiency: less internal debate than balanced triads."
      watchouts:
        - "Shadow suppression: the 15% may be ignored until it erupts."
        - "Hierarchy rigidity: sometimes the shadow should lead."
      prescriptions:

        - "In crisis, deliberately ask: 'What does my shadow see?'"

  TRIAD_STACK:
    name: "Triad Stack"
    ratio: "variable"

    adds:
      strengths:
        - "Unique configuration: your blend doesn't fit neat boxes."
